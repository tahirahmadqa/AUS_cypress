-   The project code must be cloned onto your local machine.

## Installation

1.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of the project.
    
2.  Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
    
    `npm install` 
    

## Running the tests

1.  Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to launch the Cypress Test Runner:
   
    `npx cypress open` 
    
2.  The Cypress Test Runner window should open. From here, you can select which tests to run by clicking on the relevant spec file.
    
3.  To run all tests, click on the "Run all specs" button.
    
4.  You can also run the tests headlessly by using the following command:
